It is ultra light weight, and fit well. It felt very smooth and comfortable on. I loved its snug feel, and it did pull my waist in nicely. It did not show any P-L in the clothes I was wearing One this I did not totally like about it was the narrow band seemed to roll down, and became a bit less comfortable. I had to keep pulling it up. I would recommend this to a friend, how lite feeling this is. I live in the Pacific NW Age Range 60-70 Female Body type -Full Figured 5'7 / 175lb It fit snug, with a comfortable level of 8 Yes I would recommend this product. I do recommend Bali Bras, I've worn them for years, as did my Mom.",1,0,0,5,0,,4781,"Bali Womens EasyliteÂ® High Waist Brief",14857
