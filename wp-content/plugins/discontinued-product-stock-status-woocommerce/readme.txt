== Description ==
Discontinued Product Stock Status for WooCommerce allows you to list a product as ‘<strong>Discontinued</strong>’ in your <strong>WooCommerce catalog, optionally write a custom message to guide your buyers to newer or other products</strong> and thus helping you recover lost sales and SEO traffic in the process.

Usually a store owner only uses 2 Stock status in WooCommerce – ‘<strong>In Stock</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Out of Stock</strong>’. So, they tend to put a product in ‘Out of Stock’ status even when the product is actually discontinued or will no longer be available in future or they would just delete the product page.

However, either of these actions are a loss-loss for store owners and buyers. When a product is ‘out of stock’ the buyer assumes that product will be back in stock in some time when in reality the product has been discontinued and will never be available for purchase in future. Similarly, if a store owner deletes the product page then all the SEO traffic that product page was getting is lost as the product page no longer exists. Either way, it ends up in lost revenue for the store owner.

So, to solve this problem this plugin adds a custom stock status ‘<strong>Discontinued</strong>’ so that <strong>store owners no longer have to use ‘Out of Stock’ status for discontinued products and allows them to correctly inform and guide the buyers easily</strong>.

* Supports almost all product types – <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Variation</strong>, <strong>Grouped</strong>, <strong>Virtual</strong> and <strong>Downloadable</strong>.
* Allows store owners to <strong>set a Global message for Discontinued products</strong>.
* Allows store owners to <strong>set product specific messages after setting discontinued stock status</strong>.
* Allows you to <strong>mark a simple / variable product as discontinued in advance</strong>, so after the stock quantity of an ‘instock’ product reaches zero, the product is automatically shown as discontinued. This is <strong>very useful for products that have reached end-of-life (EOL products)</strong>. Thus preventing buyers from buying something that is no going to be available in future.
* Allows store owners to <strong>set Variation-level specific messages for discontinued variations</strong> of a variable product.
* Store owners can also <strong>set a generic message on a Product level for variations & Grouped products</strong>.

**Recover Lost Sales**
Now no longer lose sales because of a miscommunication with buyers. Show them the correct status for the discontinued products, guide them and convert them.

**Don't lose SEO Traffic**
You have put a ton of money and effort into upping your SEO game and removing a product page is shooting yourself on foot.
Now with this plugin, you can show correct status for the discontinued products and avoid losing the SEO traffic
